# python-api-challenge
In this two part activity, I was challenged to use the open weather map api to pull current weather data from 500+ cities around the world. I created scatter plots to examine the relationships between temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed all compared to latitude. I then calculated linear regressions on each relationship and separated them into Northern and Southern hemisphere plots. Using this data, I used the Google Places API to plan my ideal vacation. I created a heat map to show hotels around the world in cities whose weather met my specifications.
